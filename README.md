# AutoInland Vehicle Insurance Claim
The objective of this project was to predict if a client will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next 3 months based on data collected from West Africa.This was a collaborative project.
We also derived insights from the data provided to better target customers and their needs based on gender,age and the time periods when insurance claims were likely to be made.
Some interesting insights that we found are most clients who make insurance claims are aged 30 to 41.
Additionally,most clients who make insurance claims tend to do this at the beginning of the year with a peak being observed in March and April which coincided with many holidays in that area.
Worked with  several classification models including such as Logistic regression,LGBMClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,Gradient Classifier and XGBoost.
We had the challenge of imballanced data and tried sampling to try and solve for this problem in this project
